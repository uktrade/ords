# ORDS Governance Policy
## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to outline the roles, responsibilities and processes involved in maintaining ORDS, in order to ensure the consistency, accuracy and quality of the ORDS outputs, and continued development of the standard.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Regulation Directorate
-	The Regulation Directorate is responsible for strategic decisions surrounding the use and development of ORDS.
-	It must approve major changes to the metadata standard, taking onboard feedback from stakeholder consultation.

-	They have principal responsibility for the ORDS GitHub repository, ensuring it is up-to-date and responding to Issues raised there.

## ORDS Compliance
-	To ensure ORDS is being used appropriately and effectively, periodic checks will be taken to audit content produced using ORDS. These checks are not targeted, instead they are to identify areas for the improvement of ORDS or updated training.
-	In the case of inconsistencies, the ORDS team may offer updated training to internal or external metadata taggers, or update documentation to reduce the risk of errors in the future.

## Training
To facilitate knowledge sharing training sessions will be offered to the Regulation Directorate, and external stakeholders. 
The training will provide:
1.	Introduction to ORDS – For those new to ORDS, providing them with the requisite knowledge to implement and manage ORDS tagging.
