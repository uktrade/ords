# ORDS Governance Policy
## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to outline the roles, responsibilities and processes involved in maintaining ORDS, in order to ensure the consistency, accuracy and quality of the ORDS outputs, and continued development of the standard.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### ORDS Governance Committee
-	The ORDS Governance Committee is responsible for strategic decisions surrounding the use and development of ORDS.
-	It must approve major changes to the metadata standard, taking onboard feedback from stakeholder consultation.
-	It sets long-term strategy for ORDS implementation and usage.
-	It must evaluate issues and risks raised by the ORDS team or stakeholders.

### ORDS Manager
-	The ORDS manager is responsible for the day-to-day management of ORDS.
-	They should be responsible for stakeholder interaction, including consultation on changes, and training/learning.
-	They should chair the ORDS Governance Committee, preparing the agenda and distributing minutes.
-	They have principal responsibility for the ORDS GitHub repository, ensuring it is up-to-date and responding to Issues raised there.

## ORDS Compliance
-	To ensure ORDS is being used appropriately and effectively, periodic checks will be taken to audit content produced using ORDS. These checks are not targeted, instead they are to identify areas for the improvement of ORDS or updated training.
-	Checks will involve the validation of the metadata of a random selection of regulatory documents that have been uploaded onto the Open Regulation Platform. This selection should include a random selection from Regulation Directorate produced metadata, and regulator produced metadata.
-	In the case of inconsistencies, the ORDS team may offer updated training to internal or external metadata taggers, or update documentation to reduce the risk of errors in the future.

## Training
To facilitate knowledge sharing, quarterly training sessions will be offered to the Regulation Directorate, and external stakeholders. 
The training will have two parts:
1.	An introduction to ORDS – this part of the session is for those new to ORDS, providing them with the requisite knowledge to implement and manage ORDS tagging.
2.	Updates to ORDS – this part of the session will provide updates to ORDS improvements, how they might affect stakeholders, and how to implement them.

## Documentation and Accessibility
ORDS and its documentation will be stored on our official GitHub repository. The repository is public allowing access to all. It should contain the following:
-	README file
-	Current .ttl ontology file
-	Specification
-	ORDS implementation examples
-	Version Control Policy
-	Governance Policy
-	ORDS Examples
-	Contribute file
-	Changelog
-	Usage license
-	Archive of previous versions

The ORDS manager holds responsibility for the content in the repository and keeping it up to date.

## Policy and Documentation Review and Updates

To ensure that the policies and documentation remain up-to-date it will undergo regular reviews:
- Annual Review: The ORDS Governance Committee will conduct an annual review of the policies and documentation to evaluate their effectiveness, assess any gaps, and make neccessary updates.
- Ad-Hoc Review: In addition to the annual review, policies and documentation will be reviewed whenever there are significant changes in ORDS itself, or governing policies within DBT or wider government.

Major changes to policies or documentation should be:
- Approved by the ORDS Governance Committee
- Updated on the ORDS GitHub
- Communicated to stakeholders via email
